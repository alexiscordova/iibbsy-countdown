# Is It Baseball Season Yet - Countdown
Version 4.0.0

[http://isitbaseballseasonyet.com](http://isitbaseballseasonyet.com)

Is It Baseball Season Yet (IIBBSY) is a site counting down the time until the start of the next Major League Baseball season. Since I’m a San Francisco Giants fan, it usually contains a dig at the Los Angeles Dodgers, too. No I won’t change it don’t email me.

IIBBSY is powered by a few different technologies, just because:
- React.js
- Sass
- Babel
- PostCSS
- Webpack.js
- NPM Scripts
- Node.js
- Amazon Web Services (S3)

This isn’t entirely designed to be forked or modified, but if you’re so inclined the following `npm` commands are available:

- `npm start` runs a development build (via `webpack-dev-server`) and is available at `http://localhost:3000`.
- `npm run build` runs a production build (via `webpack`) with the files being built in the `dist` directory.
